Co-Occurrence Matrix

This project demonstrates how to generate a co-occurrence matrix from a corpus of text using Python. A co-occurrence matrix is a useful NLP tool for analyzing how often words appear together within a specified context window. It provides foundational insights for tasks like word embeddings, topic modeling, and semantic analysis.

Features

Accepts raw text or tokenized input

Configurable context window size

Outputs a matrix showing word co-occurrence frequencies

Visualizes results with heatmaps or tables (optional)

Use Cases

Natural Language Processing (NLP) education

Word association exploration

Feature engineering for ML models

Text corpus exploration

Limitations

Not optimized for very large corpora

Assumes English-language tokenization

No built-in preprocessing (e.g., stemming or stopword removal)

Requirements

Python 3.x

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib (optional for visualization)
